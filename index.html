                    never written a line of code. I needed<br>
                    some strctures from professionals<br>
                    who can help me learn programming<br>
                    step by step. I was encouraged to <br>
                    enroll by a former dtudent of theirs <br>
                    who can only say wonderful things <br>
                    about the program. The entire<br>
                    curriculum and staff did not <br>
                    disappiont. They  werre very hands-on <br>
                    and i never had to wait long for <br>
                    assistancd. The agile team project, in <br>
                    particular, was outstandinf=g. It took <br>
                    my learning to the next level in a way <br>
                    that no tutorial could never have. In <br>
                    fact, I've often reffered to it during <br>
                    interviews as an example of my <br>
                    development experience. It certainly <br>
                    helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>
                    developer after receiving multiple <br>
                    offers. 100% recommend! "
